### Timeline Management Conversation

**User:** "How's the Thompson project timeline looking?"

**Sylo:** "The Thompson project is tracking well overall, but I've identified a few areas that need attention:

**Current Status: 65% Complete (Stage 3: Spatial Coordination)**

**✅ On Track:**
- Design development: 90% complete
- Client approvals: All stage 2 items signed off
- Material selections: 75% finalized

**⚠️ Attention Needed:**
- **Kitchen cabinetry**: Supplier lead time extended to 16 weeks (was 12)
- **Custom millwork**: Drawings pending final review (3 days overdue)
- **Lighting fixtures**: 2 selections still awaiting client approval

**Timeline Impact:**
- Overall project completion may delay by 1-2 weeks
- Installation sequence needs adjustment
- Final styling window becomes tighter

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate**: Follow up on millwork drawings (I can draft the email)
2. **This week**: Present remaining lighting options to client
3. **Next week**: Confirm revised installation schedule with trades

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Alternative cabinet supplier identified as backup
- Lighting selections can be fast-tracked if needed
- Buffer time remains in final styling phase

Would you like me to send the millwork follow-up email, schedule a client meeting for lighting approvals, or update the project timeline with these adjustments?
